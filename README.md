As part of the first semester of my training in DUT in Computer Science, we were asked to create a static website from A to Z whether it is the skeleton of it (HTML), its design (CSS), or its content (subject on drones) including an interview with an industry professional. This project lasted 2 months and ended in January 2018 with a presentation, a slide show and a demonstration of the site.
